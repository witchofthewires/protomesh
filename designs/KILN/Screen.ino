/*******************************************************************************
 * ESP32-32E 4" LVGL Claude Code Stub
 *
 * For the ESP32-32E 4.0" touch LCD (ST7796 320x480 + XPT2046 touch,
 * display and touch sharing one SPI bus).
 *
 * A minimal starting point for building an LVGL application from scratch on
 * this hardware.  The UI lives in a tiny ui.h / ui.cpp pair in the sketch
 * folder that draws a simple "Hello, world!" screen.
 *
 * The intent is to hand this to Claude Code (or any developer) as a clean
 * scaffold: the display, touch, and LVGL plumbing is already wired up, so you
 * can focus on writing your own UI in ui.cpp.  Just replace the contents of
 * ui_init() with your own widgets and grow from there.
 *
 * Orientation: lv_setup.begin(rotation) accepts 0 = portrait (320x480, the
 * ST7796's native orientation), 1 = landscape (480x320), 2 = portrait
 * flipped, 3 = landscape flipped (degrees 90/180/270 work as aliases for
 * 1/2/3).  This sketch defaults to portrait; change the argument below to
 * rotate.  Display and touch rotate together.
 *
 * Demonstrates touchscreen, LVGL and a hand-written UI.
 *
 * Compatible with LVGL 9; the bundled lv_conf.h is based on LVGL 9.3.  If your
 * installed LVGL differs, the API is generally close enough to adapt.
 *
 * Requires the following libraries:
 *   - chipguy_ESP32_32E_4inch_display  (display + touch driver, this library)
 *   - lvgl 9
 *
 * Arduino IDE Board Settings:
 *   - Board: "ESP32 Dev Module" (in Tools > Board > esp32).
 *   - The defaults work; the sketch fits the default partition scheme.
 *
